This kitpack adds 6 new sorcerer kits to choose from. The kits are listed below.

I made this kitpack because I LOVE playing sorcerers--especially sorcerers who 
gained their magic through weird events and happenstance, rather than bloodline.
I loved the themes of the Favored Soul sorcerer from "Tome and Blood", but I
wanted kits that weren't so... religious in nature. I set out to make kits
that weren't necessarily religious OR bloodline-based. I hope that you find
these kits thematically sound, but also vague enough to fit whatever headcanons
you have for your Charname.

This kitpack should be compatible with everything. For more arcane goodness,
I highly recommend checking out Tome and Blood.

NOTE THAT EACH KIT HAS ONE FEWER SPELLSLOT AVAILABLE FOR CASTING AS A DRAWBACK,
similar to the kits from Tome and Blood.

------------------------------------
-- HOW TO USE
------------------------------------
Select the desired kit when creating your character. The (dis)advantages will
be applied automatically.

In order to get the extra spells, go to your Special Abilities menu and use the
"Sphere Selection" thing. You will get a dialogue--just go through that and you'll
get the spells.

-- THANKS AND CREDITS
------------------------------------
	Lava and Subtledoctor, whose code I yoinked
	The Artisan, for helping me figure out what the hell I was doing
	Moggadeet and DimNussens, for helping with some of the kit flavor text
	"Aberrant Mind" sorc is inspired by the 5E sorc of the same name
	The name "Fatespinner" was yoinked from a forum

------------------------------------
-- KNOWN ISSUES
------------------------------------
- The bonuses of the Solar Adept might not be working, but the bonus spells are there.
- The Save VS Death of the Felltouched might not be working, but everything else is there
- If you have The Artisan's Candlekeep Revisited, your character may say one of Gorion's lines
when casting the Sphere Selection spell. I don't know why that is, but everything still works
as it's supposed to in both mods.

-- THE KITS
------------------------------------
WILLBINDER Sorcerers can obtain their magic in a myriad of ways--unlike Draconic sorcerers, 
there is no common origin for Willbinders. What they all have in common, though, is that 
they are strong-willed, and their magic often manifests in ways that overwhelms the psychological 
fortitude of their opponents, bending their enemy to the sorcerer's desire.
Bonus Spells:
	Command
	Cloak of Fear
	Bolt of Glory
	Power Word: Silence
	Power Word: Kill
Notes: Immune to Charm, cannot be chaotic, Charisma must be 14+

------------------------------------
------------------------------------
FATESPINNER Sorcerers: The magic of Fatespinners is innate and often of unknown origin, 
though some suspect that energies from Pandemonium may be involved somehow. Despite the 
magic's murky origins, one thing is clear: a Fatespinner's magic manifests in ways that 
seem to bend reality itself, bringing luck to their allies and misfortune to their enemies. 
Bonus Spells:
	Doom
	Chant
	Miscast Magic
	Magic Resistance
Notes: permanent Good Luck, cannot be lawful 

------------------------------------
------------------------------------
ABERRANT MIND: The secrets of reality itself seem to readily reveal itself to aberrant
mind sorcerers, who have an uncanny way of noticing and knowing things--magical and 
mundane alike. Unfortunately, they tend to have a slightly unsettling presence to others.
Perhaps these sorcerers are touched by an entity of the Far Realms or some psionic creature, 
or perhaps the magic comes from somewhere else altogether.
Bonus Spells
	Find Traps
	Farsight
	Chaotic Commands
	True Sight
Notes: Immune to Confusion, wisdom must be 14+, gets -2 to charisma (max is 16 CHA on character creation)

------------------------------------
------------------------------------
SOLAR ADEPT: These sorcerers manifest the power of the sun itself. In times past, these
sorcerers were believed to be blessed by Amaunator, though it is unknown if that was
truly the case. Today, these sorcerers are valued by Lathander's clergy for their natural
proficiency in combating undead.
Bonus Spells
	Flame Blade
	Protection from Fire
	Flame Strike
	False Dawn
Notes: minor fire and cold resistance (15% each), -2 AC bonus against undead

------------------------------------
------------------------------------
FELL TOUCHED: Grim of aspect, the Fell-Touched Sorcerer was once believed a harbinger of death, 
accused of drawing upon the Shadow Weave. While their magic calls upon the same Weave as any other 
sorcerer's, it is not wholly of the Prime, lending itself more easily to spells of life and death. In 
ages past, many found a place among Myrkul's favored, but they are not evil, merely attuned to darkness 
and mortality in a way that some find off-putting.
Bonus Spells
	Sanctuary
	Animate Dead
	Death Ward
	Negative Plane Protection
Notes: +4 bonus to save VS death, -2 charisma (max is 16 CHA on character creation)

------------------------------------
------------------------------------
FEY TOUCHED: The Fey-Touched sorcerer walks a strange path, calling upon nature as easily as 
<PRO_HESHE> manipulates the Weave. Though often found among those close to nature, these sorcerers seldom 
follow the druids' ethos. Theirs is an old tradition that draws upon the magic of wild places much as a nymph's 
does, and these sorcerers are proof against fey trickery.

Bonus Spells
	Entangle
	Zone of Sweet Air
	Insect Plague
	Nature's Beauty
Notes: Immune to Charm, +1 charisma (can get to 19 CHA on character creation)

-- FUTURE PLANS
------------------------------------
- Give the Felltouched Sorc the Shadow Step ability and some Shadowdancer HLAs
- Give the Solar Adept sorc a bonus to outside during the day
- Maybe add some wizard kits so the "Arcane Archetypes" name is a bit more fitting to the kitpack
